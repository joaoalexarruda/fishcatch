# FISHCATCH

This repository contains the 'fishcatch' dataset. The dataset is part of an assignment for the post graduation course ['Data Science and Digital Transformation'](https://www.ipportalegre.pt/pt/oferta-formativa/pos-graduacao-data-science-and-digital-transformation) at the Instituto Politécnico de Portalegre (IPP).

The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to the dataset and to evaluate the results. In this case, regression techniques will be used to predict the width of the fish based on the other variables.

## DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT

159 fishes of 7 species are caught and measured. Altogether there are 8 variables.  All the fishes are caught from the same lake (Laengelmavesi) near Tampere in Finland.

More information about the dataset can be found in the [original source](https://jse.amstat.org/datasets/fishcatch.txt).

## ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS

The assignment requires the tasks described in the [pdf](./task-description/ADAA_23.24_TrabalhoPrático.pdf) file.
